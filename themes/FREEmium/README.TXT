FREEmium

Released for free by FreebiesDock.com
Authors: Paul Kadysz (design) and Dariusz Siedlecki (frontend)

WordPress 2.7 ready theme with two sidebars, widgetized! Doesn't require any extra plugins, supports the new comment system in WP 2.7 and the flickrRSS plugin by eightface (http://eightface.com/wordpress/flickrrss/). Uses the LavaLamp jQuery plugin by Ganeshji Marwaha (http://www.gmarwaha.com/blog/?p=7).

EXTRA FEATURES
------------------------------------------------------
To display photos in posts on the main page, you have to add a custom field with the name of "image" and input a full URL to it as a value. It should be 350px wide.

You can uncomment the 30th line of code in header.php to enable subscription via e-mail through FeedBurner.

The top menu lists all the pages you have on your blog - so if you have more than five pages, it might look a little stretchy ;-).

When enabling the flickrRSS plugin as a widget, you have to put <ul> and </ul> as the elements before and after the widget (in the widget options).
