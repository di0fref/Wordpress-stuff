  <p>That's &quot;404: File not found&quot; for the technically inclined.
    For the  not-so-technically inclined, that means that the link you clicked, or  the URL you typed into your browser, didn't work for some reason. Here  are some possible reasons why: </p>
  <ol>
      <li>Despite all the time and effort that goes into this site it seems a &quot;bad&quot; link slipped through, and you were unlucky enough to click it. </li>
      <li>You may have typed the page address incorrectly. </li>
      <li>This web server is going nutty. </li>
  </ol>
    <h4>So now what?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You can <a href="/contact">contact</a> me and rant over this 404.</li>
      <li>If you know the name of the feature, you might try our <a href="/archives">archives</a>. </li>
		</ul>
